#### Hey there! Im ``byt3r``
This is my blog.
For a while now I've been wanting to make one, apparently writing is a good hobby.

I mainly write on general software development, software security, reverse engineering and random cool stuff.

This blog was created with Github Pages, Jekyll and some modifications to the default 'Minima' theme. It also has a dark mode (check it out!).
